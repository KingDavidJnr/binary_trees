# Binary Trees
A binary tree is a rooted tree that is also an ordered tree (a.k.a. plane tree) in which every node has at most two children. A rooted tree naturally imparts a notion of levels (distance from the root), thus for every node a notion of children may be defined as the nodes connected to it a level below (Wikipedia).

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, **without the help of Google:**

### General
* What is a binary tree
* What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
* What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
* What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
* What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
* What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree
